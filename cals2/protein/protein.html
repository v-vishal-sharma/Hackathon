      <h4>What is adjusted body weight?</h4>
      <p>
        Adjusted body weight (sometimes abbreviated to AjBW) is a measure used
        for calculating a person's nutritional needs, popular among dietitians
        when they are tasked with setting up a weight loss program. It is
        especially useful when the patient is overweight or obese. As adipose
        tissue is less metabolically active than lean tissue, using actual body
        weight for calculating one's energy requirements might result in some
        overestimations for people above their healthy BMI. Hence, it's often
        recommended to use AjBW instead.
      </p>
      <h4>How to use the adjusted body weight calculator?</h4>
      <p>
        To use our calculator, follow these instructions: <br />

        1. Provide the calculator with your sex. <br />
        2.Input your height. <br />
        3.Input your actual body weight. <br />
        4.The adjusted body weight calculator will use your sex, height and
        weight to figure out your ideal weight, which is a component of the
        adjusted body weight formula. Please note that there are several
        accepted equations used for calculating ideal weight, based on slightly
        different scientific theories. However, the differences in results are
        practically negligible, so you shouldn't worry about them. You can read
        more about these theories at our ideal weight calculator. In this
        calculator, we use the Robinson formula. <br />
        5.The calculator will use the values you provided to calculate your AjBW
        and display it to you in the bottom-most field.
      </p>
      <h4>Limitations of the adjusted body weight calculator</h4>
      <p>
        It's essential to keep in mind that the adjusted body weight calculator
        is not appropriate in all situations. One should only use it when their
        excess weight comes from adipose tissue.
